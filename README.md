Here is my package to stream upcomming VTF tournaments!

If it's your first time:
1) Make sure you extracted Streamer kit.rar in C:\Streamer kit, otherwise you will need to set everything in OBS manually.
2) Install Fonts from install\fonts
3) Install Snaz from install\SnazSetup at C:\Snaz. (Should be the default anyway) and after intalling change Snaz like in install\snaz.png

How to setup overlay for the match:
1) Open start from C:\Streamer kit or launch main.exe from C:\Streamer kit\python
2) Open OBS Studio and Click on Scene Collection (top menu), then click import
3) Import [team1]-[team2].json file (it was generated from python file) from C:\Streamer kit
4) Click on Scene Collection again and click the match you want to stream.
and that's all you need to do.
