Hello there!
Here is my package to stream upcomming VTF tournaments!
Let's start from what you need to do:
1) Make sure you extracted Streamer kit.rar in C:\Streamer kit, otherwise you will need to set everything in obs manually.
2) Install Fonts from install\fonts
3) Install Snaz from install\SnazSetup at C:\Snaz. (Should be the default anyway) and after intalling change Snaz like in install\snaz.png
4) Open OBS Studio and Click on Scene Collection (up)
5) Press Import
6) Import IOS_VTF.json file from C:\Streamer kit
7) Once everything is setup, check if the fonts are being displayed as they should, if not edit them or ask me if needed.
8) Before every match launch main.exe from "C:\Streamer kit\python\main.exe" and copy the URL and paste it in H2H scene.
Warning: If you wouldnt see team logos changing, double click on them and click "Refresh cashe of current page".

I think that's all.
If you have any questions pm me [Janir#6949] or ask in #vfc-staff channel.
